# metaltoolchain
(I don't know why I made a repo for this)<br/>

I made this script to create a library of mine.<br/>
I don't know if it compiles correctly on other systems<br/>
since it's only getting tested on the Dreamcast<br/>

## usage
mark it as executable and then run it, that's it.<br/>
make sure you don't have a version of sh-elf already<br/> 

# Known Issues
you may have to build newlib seperate<br/>
debian/ubuntu is supported only, for now<br/>
