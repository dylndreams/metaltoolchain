# metaltoolchain
(I don't know why I made a repo for this)<br/>
The setuptoolchain script is used to compile/recompile the sh-elf toolchain easily. It is a dependency for the upcoming libLUCID library that I'm working on. However, anything that has a SuperH CPU can use this toolchain.

## usage
Mark it as executable, this can be easily done with:
`chmod +x setuptoolchain`
